# Meeting Notes - 04/12 

- Discussed test benching formatting

- Need to order test bench for particular instructions:
	- e.g. LW, SW, ADDIU, JR
	- How do we do that in bash? Could split it into 2 folders. 

- Finish publishing our instructions into github then merge to main branch

- Byteenable needs to be set during reads/writes.

- Begin creating test benches for our instructions in prepraration for the formative assessment.
