# Meeting Notes

## 23/11

- Start on instruction test benches now as they are irrespective of CPU implementation.

- OPCODE is 6 bits.

Split opcode instruction so that each person does 9 instructions:
- Simon: ANDI to BNE (inclusive)
- PV: DIV to LH
- Salman: LHU to MULTU
- Myriam: OR to SLTIU
- Adam: SLTU to XORI

Tasks for 25/11:
- OPCODE's finished and commented.
- Start on the respective test benches.
- Familiarise with MIPS CA, for example Chapter 7 of "Book on CA" link.

- MIPS IV Instruction Set In-depth PDF: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/mips-iv.pdf.
- Book on CA (especially useful is chapter 7): https://moodlearn.ariel.ac.il/pluginfile.php/1649872/mod_resource/content/0/%5BDavid_Harris%2C_Sarah_Harris%5D_Digital_Design_and_Co%28b-ok.xyz%29.pdf
